## AD 300 Building a Simple Word Frequency Counter 
This Java project is for the "Building a Simple Word Frequency Counter " assignment in my AD 300 class. It demonstrates how the Java Collections framework can be used to create data structures that fit towards specific use cases in programs. For this program, we implemented a Hashmap to count repeat occurences of words in a string, and also utilized a Treemap to sort the words. This results in a word count that appears after the user inputs multiple words into the terminal.
